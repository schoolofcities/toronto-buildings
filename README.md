Made this quick interactive map of building heights in toronto (2025 data)

This stemmed out of want a simple component/example for [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe) -> [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) -> [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) workflow that we can use for other projects where we want to create interactive maps with specific data.

Why building heights? It's a good example dataset (~300mb .shp rendered down to ~40mb or so) and pretty interesting to explore to see patterns of development. There have been others (myself included) who have made similar interactive maps
- https://jonathancritchley.ca/height.html
- https://jamaps.github.io/toronto_building_heights_map/
but unfortunately these links no longer work. So I thought it would be nice to have a live example with more recent data.
